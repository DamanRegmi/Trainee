# What is Data Engineering?

* Data engineering involves the processes and techniques used to prepare data for analytical or operational purposes.
* Data engineers build and maintain the infrastructure that allows data to flow seamlessly through systems, ensuring that it is clean, organized, and available for end-users.

---
# Key Responsibilities

- Design and implement data pipelines for efficient data flow.
- Develop and maintain databases and data warehouses.
- Ensure data quality and integrity through validation and cleansing processes.

---
# Key Responsibilities
- Collaborate with data scientists and analysts to understand data requirements.
- Optimize data storage solutions for performance and scalability.

# Data Pipeline Architecture

A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps that involve the collection, transformation, and storage of data. The architecture typically includes:
- **Data Sources**: Various origins of data, such as databases, APIs, and flat files.
- **ETL Processes**: Extract, Transform, Load processes that prepare data for analysis.
